# Camrbidge SKA Science Data Challenge 3 (SKA SDC3) - Foregrounds
## OSKAR Simulation
The first step is to remove the point sources in the SKA SDC3 data by simulating with [OSKAR](https://github.com/OxfordSKA/OSKAR) ([Dulwich et al., 2009](https://pos.sissa.it/132/031/pdf)).
The SKA End-to-End simulation pipeline we used can be found [here](https://github.com/ycliu23/SKA_Power_Spectrum_and_EoR_Window), 
which is based on [this version](https://github.com/oharao/SKA_Power_Spectrum_and_EoR_Window) with a modified sky model. The full sky is composed of an outer sky that covers the $\mathrm{2\pi}$ steradians above the horizon and an inner sky model defined within the first null of the station beam pattern at 106 MHz. We use the GLEAM and LoBES catalogue [GLMv2_LoBES03Mar2022_combine.fits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14nfYmwlyqL7NzMqWtMxYfaFBccrjxKll/view?usp=drive_link) provided by the SKAO to simulate a 4-hour track observation of point sources that consists of 1440 time steps, each integrating over 10 seconds. The observation also covers the same frequency range as in the SDC3 from 106 MHz to 196 MHz, with intervals of 0.1 MHz. The simulation is for the point source subtraction from the images of 

## Imaging
The imaging process utilizes <WSCLEAN> ([Offringa et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.1943.pdf)) to grid and inverse Fourier transform the visibilities generated by $OSKAR$ to images by accounting for the sky curvature (ie. w-terms).
